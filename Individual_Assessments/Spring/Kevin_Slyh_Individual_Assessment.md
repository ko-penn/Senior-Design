My individual contribution to this Seek and Hide was being a front-end developer. I primarily worked on UI changes, however, I also worked on implementing new pages and multi-platform functionalities. These tasks greatly built upon the strong base of skills I had going into this project in regards to my programming proficiencies with mobile development. Additionally, I kept meeting minutes and helped assign each member their weekly tasks. This aspect of project coordination was building upon all the team based work I have done in previous semesters and classes.

In terms of the new skills that I learned, I previously had no experience with React Native (and by extension JavaScript). It was interesting to see the differences between React Native and Angular which I have extensive experience with. There were many times where I struggled to implement something in JavaScript that I immediately knew how to implement using TypeScript. Another new skill was using Expo Go to develop across multiple platforms using the same code. This was an extremely interesting tool to me that I could definitely see myself using again in the future. Before this experience, I had always been afraid of making a mobile application because I thought that I would need to make separate code for each platform that I wanted to be deployed on. However, now I know it is as simple as selecting the correct tools.
