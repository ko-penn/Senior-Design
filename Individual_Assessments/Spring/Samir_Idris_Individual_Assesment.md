My individual contribution to this project was mainly focused on the backend. I helped with the login and creation 
of accounts on the application. Additionally, I also helped with the storage of images of the user. I was able to apply
and build upon the skills from my initial assessment in the fall. The biggest takeaway from what I worked on is that it 
is very important to know how the multiple applications used interact with each other.

Because we worked on different platforms, I realized that the backend worked almost in the same way for all of them. 
The problem was the front end because of how the OS handled different inputs and outputs, and even bundling the application.
The obstacles I faced in the backend came from Expo not pairing well with some of the services of AWS, because of this more 
research and shortcuts had to be made in order to make our application work. We didn’t have any obstacles that we didn’t overcome, 
and because of this, we learned a lot.
