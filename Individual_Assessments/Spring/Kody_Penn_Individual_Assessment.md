My contribution to this Seek and Hide was the user interface, documentation, and debugging. I applied my JavaScript, React, and UI design skills to build the UI. The app we built allows users to be paired and then search for each other with directions from the app. The goal is to bring people with similar interests together in person and form a meaningful connection.

Our app uses React Native so it can be run on IOS, Android, and Web and we chose to use the Expo framework. I learned about different AWS services (mostly Amplify and S3), React Native, Expo, JavaScript, and UI design. I had a few obstacles on the front-end, the main two being using geolocation IOS, Android, and Web and getting Expo and AWS to work together. I was able to turn both of those obstacles into successes and had more successes in other parts of the front-end.
