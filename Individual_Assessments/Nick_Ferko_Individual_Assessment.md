From an individual academic perspective, this project means a lot. For one this is
another experience I can talk to interviewers about when searching for jobs and also an addition
to my resume. I’ll also be able to work on my communication skills in a group setting.
Communication is one of the most important skills needed for professions. Along with learning
key skills and approving them, I will also be able to work on technical skills. This could be a new language or even add to the experience I have with one. It will also be helpful working with
others when coding is involved as it will force me to not make spaghetti code for others to be
able to read.

My college curriculum had a few classes in which I expected myself to use what I
learned and apply it to this project. The first class that will help is CS2021 (Python
programming). This was my first introduction to a programming class and this was
where I first had to sit down and design a solution for a problem presented some of
these problems definitely challenged me at the time and I plan on using these
problem-solving skills in the senior design project. The next class I would say is Data
Structures CS 2028C. With this, I was also presented with tough problems except this
time with a group where I had to brainstorm with others and work together as a team to
solve a solution that I remember being difficult. I will use what I learned to communicate
with my team members effectively and listen to everyone's ideas as the more brains the
better.

I definitely have more co-op experience that will help during this senior design
compared to my college curriculum. In my first co-op, I worked at a small company
called Tiny Home Consulting and my official title was software programmer where I did
front-end and back-end programming. Technically speaking I worked a lot with Git which
will be very helpful for our project as we store our code in GitHub. I also worked with the
front end and back end so I have an understanding of how the back end communicates
with the front end. Lastly, technically speaking if we use a program I used such as
angular js, .Net, or React then I will be able to apply my knowledge to the programs as
well. The next Company I worked for is where I would say I got more non-technical skills
compared to working at Tiny Home Consulting. The company is Siemens and I definitely
approved my technical skills but this was also my first big company where they did
sprints and I was communicating and sharing code with a lot more people than before.
Because of this I learned/improved upon skills such as communication, documentation,
and others I’m sure I can’t think of right now. The documentation skills I improved upon
will especially help with this project as this first semester is a lot about documenting.

I am excited to participate in this project this is a way to display what I have
learned over all the years. The current project idea also sounds exciting as it will be a
cool way for people to interact. In general as well I love doing little programming
projects with friends as it’s always a blast for me. While this is more than a little project I
am working with people that I have worked with before and it was enjoyable.Overall
excited to see what us 4 can make when we put our minds together.

My approach to solving a solution is first defining/identifying the problem. This will
help in designing a solution. If a problem is large my design solution will involve small
tasks that will build up to the end goal. Our group is planning on doing this but we still
need to decide if we are doing a scrum or kanban process for the project. These
processes are very helpful when moving towards a goal as it takes something large and
doesn’t make it seem as intimidating since it is a smaller task. In my past co-ops, I have
done both processes and I can’t really say I have a favorite between the two.
