My name is Nicholas Ferko I'm majoring in computer science at the University of Cincinnati. I have always loved technology and solving problems. This is what drew me towards computer science in the first place. I'm also someone who values my work ethic and being someone who is a dependable person others can count on.

# Project Sought

I'm open to a wide variety of projects. I always love to learn new skills such as new programming languages/programs or some topic I'm not familiar with. I came into this class with the initial idea of something AI related as I'm sure a lot of people also did. But again like I said I don't have a narrow view of what sort of project I would want as I love to learn, explore, and take on challenges.
