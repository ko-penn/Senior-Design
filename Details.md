# Project Description
Project Title: Seek and Hide
This is a Social app where you get notified if a user is nearby and you try to identify who it is. The user uploads either a picture of themselves or a description of what they are wearing and other users will be notified if they are in close enough proximity. The primary purpose is to connect people virtually and physically.
