Economic, security, and social are the topical areas that factor into Seek and Hide. We are planning to utilize Freeware/open-sources. Freeware may be more challenging to implement in our solution, but we prefer this challenge rather than an expensive solution paid out of our pockets. Fortunately, we all already own devices that are capable of developing our solution so we are not restricted to UC facilities. Our solution won’t be contributing economically to society at the moment. There are some privacy concerns as we are going to be tracking the user’s locations while they are using the app. Additionally, if we decide to have the users create an account, their login information will be sensitive information that we would need to protect. Our app will be beneficial for society as it seeks to connect people. This app has the potential to be used by various agencies and organizations as a way to help connect people with their organization. Our solution does not currently integrate professional, ethical, legal, environmental, and diversity and cultural factors.
